# Dev Task 2

Exercise has been completed using php 7.4

Tests provided and also a small docker image to run them
```shell
docker build . -t dev-task-2
docker run dev-task-2
```
Two branches provided here. Quite similar. There's a [pull request](https://github.com/crevillo/dev-task-2/pull/1) where I explain what I did that other
branch. Basically as the problem asked to use 2 params for the LoadBalancer constructor, I decided to 
keep it like that and suggest this other improvement. 

Travis builds are created also here for php 7.4, 8.0 and 8.1 (nightly)
